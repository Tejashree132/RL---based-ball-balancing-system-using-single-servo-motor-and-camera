# RL---based-ball-balancing-system-using-single-servo-motor-and-camera
This project uses Reinforcement Learning to balance a ball on a beam by adjusting the beam’s angle via a servo motor. A camera tracks the ball’s position, giving real-time feedback to the RL agent, which learns through rewards to maintain stability. It combines control, vision, and machine learning.
